Develop a simple web application page that allows users to browse and filter product listings from a database. Use React and Redux to create an interface and manage application state. Interact with the API to retrieve and store data from the database.
Create an application consisting of several components: a header, a search field, a list of products, and a form for adding a new product.
Use React Router to create application routes that allow users to navigate between pages.
Use Redux to manage application state. Create reducers and actions that allow you to add, remove, and update products.
Create a product list component that receives data from the Redux store and displays it as a table with columns: ID, name, description, price, photo, rating, stock, category. Add the ability to sort and filter the product by each column.
Add a search box that allows users to search for products by name or category. The product list component should update automatically when the user enters a query in the search field.
Create a form to add a new product. Use Formik and Yup to validate your input. The form must contain the following fields: Name, Author, Year of publication, Rating.
Add the ability to remove an item from the list and from the Redux store.
